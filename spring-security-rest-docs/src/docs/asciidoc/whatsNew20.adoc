=== Grails 3 support

This major release is working with Grails 3. It's based on Spring Security Core plugin version 3.x, which in turn uses
Spring Security 4, so make sure you read carefully what the new versions have changed:

https://grails-plugins.github.io/grails-spring-security-core/v3/index.html#newInV3[]

[WARNING]
====
The plugin it's still on a milestone release stage, which means that some things might change in the final `2.0.0`.
In particular, the main change in the roadmap is the modularisation of the different token storages support. They will
be published as separated artifacts.

Interfaces in the Groovy API might also be refactored.

Special thanks to https://github.com/Schlogen[James Kleeh] for his help in the initial upgrade steps.

=== Plugin broken down into multiple modules

Starting from this version, `org.grails.plugins:spring-security-rest` just contains support for JWT. Artifact size has
been reduced from 429 KB in version 1.5.3 to 194K in 2.0.x!

For those using a different token storage system, the following artifacts are also published:

* `org.grails.plugins:spring-security-rest-gorm`.
* `org.grails.plugins:spring-security-rest-grailscache`.
* `org.grails.plugins:spring-security-rest-memcached`.
* `org.grails.plugins:spring-security-rest-redis`.

The version is the same in all modules. For more details, check the <<configuration>> section.

As a consequence, configuration properties like `grails.plugin.springsecurity.rest.token.storage.useMemcached` are no
longer used.

=== CORS is now supported in Grails core

As of Grails 3.2.1, Grails natively supports CORS. Refer to the http://docs.grails.org/3.2.0/[Grails documentation] for
more information about how to configure it.

=== JWT improvements

As of this version, there is no longer a default value for the configuration property
`plugin.springsecurity.rest.token.storage.jwt.secret`. Furthermore, if you are using JWT and no value has
been provided for that configuration property, an exception will be thrown during application startup.

It is also possible to influence the JWT generation by providing additional claims. Finally, the signing / encryption
algorithms used are configurable. Check the <<tokenGeneration>> section for more information.

=== Other minor updates

* Classes have been annotated with `@CompileStatic`, for performance reasons.
* Documentation has been migrated to Asciidoctor.
* All libraries used have been upgraded to their latest versions.
* Snapshots are now published automatically to https://oss.jfrog.org[Artifactory OSS] on every successful build. You can
  use them by defining this Maven repository inside the `repositories` block in your `build.gradle`:

  maven { url "https://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local" }
